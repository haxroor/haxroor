## ðŸ§  About me:
I'm a Computer Science student at University of Rome Tor Vergata, occasionally working on personal projects to enhance my skills and broaden my perspective. I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems and experimenting with simple projects to learn new programming languages or frameworks.
